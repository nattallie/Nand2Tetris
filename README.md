 From Nand to Tetris - Building a Modern Computer From First Principles
 
 
This repository includes projects from Nand to Tetris course. The complete Nand to Tetris experience spans 12 projects - it starts with Boolean Logic and ends with Operating System. From student's perspective I can say that this course helped me realize what it actually means when computer work in 0's and 1's.
