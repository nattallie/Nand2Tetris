 From Nand to Tetris - Building a Modern Computer From First Principles
 
The Nand to Tetris course's projects are included in this repository. The 12-project journey from Nand to Tetris begins with Boolean Logic and ends with Operating System. I can speak from the perspective of a student and say that this course made me aware of what it really means when computers work in 0s and 1s.
